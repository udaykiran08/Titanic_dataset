Certainly! Here's a description of how you can preprocess the Titanic dataset using encoders and the train-test split technique:

Description:

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset often used for machine learning practice. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

Preprocessing Steps:

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset. This may involve imputing missing values with mean, median, or mode for numerical features and using the most frequent category for categorical features.
Drop irrelevant features: Remove features that are not relevant or informative for predicting survival status, such as PassengerId or Name.
Feature Encoding:
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. This ensures that categorical variables can be used as input for machine learning models.
Example: Encode the "Sex" feature with label encoding (e.g., male = 0, female = 1) or one-hot encoding (create binary columns for each category).
Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train-test split technique. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
Example: Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y), then use the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets with a specified test size (e.g., 20% of the data).
